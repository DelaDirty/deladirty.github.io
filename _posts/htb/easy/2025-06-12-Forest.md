# Overview

## Full Port Scan and Initial Enumeration
 
I initiated a full TCP port scan using aggressive timing to identify open services quickly.

---

```bash

nmap -sCV -p- <ip or box name> --min-rate=1000 --min-parallelism=1000 -v
```

**Key Flags:**
- `-sC`: runs default Nmap scripts
- `-sV`: enables version detection
- `-p-`: Scans all 65535 ports
- `--min-rate=1000`: sends packets faster than the default rate.
- `--min-parallelism=1000`: sends probes in parallel for speed.

I only use `--min-rate` and `--min-parallelism` in CTF environments to accelerate discovery.

```

Examining our Nmap scan, we can see that it reveals ports 53 (DNS), 88 (Kerberos), 139 and 445 (SMB), and 389 (LDAP). Ports 88 Kerberos and 389 LDAP are good indicators that this is a Domain Controller, and we are most likely dealing with an Active Directory box.  

We observe some OS discovery indicating that the operating system is Windows Server 2016, with the computer name being 'forest'. We also see that os-discovery identified the domain name as htb.local.  

The first port I will scrutinize is SMB. The reason for this is that SMB is generally quick and easy to enumerate.  

With SMB, we can check if we have null sessions or if guest accounts are available to connect with and possibly enumerate users.

---

## SMB Enumeration

The first thing I like to do with SMB is to enumerate for Null sessions.  

```
smbclient -L \\\\10.129.236.33\\ -N
```
**Key Flags:**
- `-L`: This option allows you to list the existing shares.
- `-N`: Allows us to try and connect to SMB without credentials (Null Session) 

We see that the login was successful, but no shares are visible.  

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/2.png)

Just because this doesn't render any information doesn't mean we're done here. Multiple tools can be used to enumerate SMB, such as smbclient, smbmap, enum4linux, and netexec with proper flags. Smbmap would essentially give us the same information as smbclient, but what about enum4linux?

```bash
enum4linux -a 10.129.236.33
```

**Key Flags:**
- `-a`: This option will run a full enumeration scan using various flags that enum4linux has.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/3.png)

After the scan has completed, we can see that in the users portion, there are a few users that stand out, such as `Lucinda`, `Santi`, `svc-alfresco`, `Sebastien`, `Andy`, and `Mark`.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/4.png)

What we will end up doing is adding all these users to a text file using your preferred text editor; I like to use Sublime.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/5.png)

> Why add these users to a list?
> We may find a user list valuable if we discover passwords and need to spray them. It is also possible that it may be used for later attacks, but ultimately, it helps us keep track of the information we find as we go through these boxes. You may need to refer back to it later or provide evidence that you indeed found a possible user.

Another helpful piece of information we received from enum4linux is the policy details. We can see that the minimum password length is set to 7 with no complexity and no lockout threshold.

## AS-Rep Roasting With Impacket

So far, we have gathered a small list of users with little to no progress, or so we think.  

From our Nmap scan, we stated that we saw port 88 Kerberos open. Kerberos is the authentication backbone in Active Directory environments. If any account were to be misconfigured with pre-authentication disabled, this would allow an attacker to exploit the misconfiguration by extracting Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) from the Domain Controller, where they could attempt to crack them offline.  

Since we have a list of users, we can check with the DC if any of these accounts are misconfigured, which may result in a TGT. There are several tools we can use to accomplish this task; the most popular one is Impacket's `GetNPUsers` script.

```bash
impacket-GetNPUsers htb.local/ -usersfile users.txt -dc-ip 10.129.236.33 -no-pass
```

**Key Flags:**
Impacket-GetNPUsers requires a positional argument for the target, which is generally `[[domain/]username[:password]]`. However, since we are using a user list, we only need to add the domain, which is htb.local, according to our original Nmap output.
- `-usersfile`: allows for a user list to be used.
- `-dc-ip`: This option needs the DC's IP address.
- `-no-pass`: doesn't ask for a password

What we get back is svc-alfresco's TGT. This means that the pre-authentication option was disabled for user `svc-alfresco`.  

With this being said, we can copy the extracted TGT into a text file and crack it with hashcat.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/7.png)

Once we have the file, we will run Hashcat to crack it and hopefully retrieve a password from it.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/8.png)

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/9.png)

We now have valid credentials for `svc-alfresco`. Now we can run NetExec to see if we can access the system. Our Nmap results indicate that port 5985 is associated with WinRM.

```bash
netexec winrm 10.129.236.33 -u svc-alfresco -p 'pass here'
```
![](/assets/images/htb/forest/10.png)

Before we log in, we want to check what we can do with svc-alfresco, and the best way to do that is by running BloodHound.


---

## BloodHound

Now we will run BloodHound to gain a visual understanding of what `svc-alfresco` is capable of before moving forward. We want to be prepared to move forward.

```bash
bloodhound-python -ns 10.129.236.33 -d htb.local -u svc-alfresco -p <pass here> -c all --zip
```

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/11.png)

Once we have our zip, we will open Bloodhound locally, ingest the zip file, and search for `svc-alfresco@htb.local` and click on the Node.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/12.png)

On the right-hand side, we will see `member of`, and we noticed that `svc-alfresco` is in a few privileged groups.  

If we proceed with path finding and use `svc-alfresco@htb.local` as the starting node and `administrator@htb.local` as the destination. We will be given a path to take from this account to admin.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/13.png)

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/14.png)

Following the line on BloodHound, we see all the groups `svc-alfresco` is a part of up until `Account Operators@htb.local`. From there onward, we notice that because `svc-alfresco` is a part of `Account Operators` group, they will have generic All permissions to `Exchange Windows Permissions@htb.local`. 

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/15.png)

According to Hacking Articles With Generic All permissions, we can change passwords, modify group memberships, Abuse delegated controls, and delete or modify objects.  

![Hacking Article GenericAll](https://www.hackingarticles.in/genericall-active-directory-abuse/)

 Before we start doing any of these things, let's take a look further down the line. We have Generic All permissions to the group `Exchange Windows Permissions@htb.local`. The Abuse for this would be to create a new user, add them to `Exchange Windows Permissions`, and then use PowerView to give the new user DCSync permissions.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/16.png)

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/23.png)

From `Exchange Windows Permissions`, we have WriteDACL permissions on the domain object htb.local.  

**This means we can modify its access control list and grant ourselves replication rights.**

With these rights, we can run a DCSync attack, essentially pretending to be the DC and dump password hashes for any user including `administrator` by using `impacket-secretsdump`.

## Foothold 

Our foothold is simple; we already have the credentials to gain entry. I just wanted to be thorough and establish an attack path so that we can gain access and escalate our privileges as soon as possible.

Previously, we ran NetExec and saw that `svc-alfresco` was able to log in through WinRM.  

```bash
winrm -i 10.129.236.33 -u svc-alfresco -p 'pass here'
```

Once logged in, if we navigate to `c:\users\svc-alfresco\desktop`, we will see the `user.txt` file.  

We can `cat` the file and grab our first flag.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/19.png)

---

## Privilege Escalation

This will be easy and quick since we have already done the legwork to figure out how to go from `svc-alfresco` to administrator.  

While we are on the system as `svc-alfresco`, we will use net user to `/add` a user with a password.  

```bash
net user Dirty password123! /add
```

> **note:** With `net user` the positional agruments would be <user> and then <password>. In my case, `Dirty` will be my username, and the password will be `password123`.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/20.png)

Once this is done, we will now go ahead and `/add` our user to `Exchange Windows Permissions`.

```bash
net group 'Exchange Windows Permission' Dirty /add
```

> **note:** With net group we will add the positional arguments <group> and then <user>.

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/21.png)

We can verify this information by using the `net user` command to look up our user.  

```bash
net user Dirty
```

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/22.png)



Now that we have added a user to the necessary group, we will need to grant our user DCSync privileges.  

We will need to upload Powerview.ps1 onto the system.  

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/24.png)

We will now import Powerview.ps1

```bash
ipmo .\powerview.ps1
```
![](/assets/images/htb/forest/25.png)

Let's create a PSCredential object.  

```powershell
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('htb\Dirty', $SecPassword)
```
With Powerview imported, we will now run the following command.

```bash
Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $Cred -TargetIdentity "DC=htb,DC=local" -PrincipalIdentity Dirty -Rights DCSync
```

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/26.png)

This will grant us the DCSync rights we need to complete the process of obtaining the admin's hash.

Finally, on our system, we will run `impacket-secretsdump`

```bash
impacket-secretsdump htb.local/Dirty:'Password123!'@10.129.236.33
```

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/27.png)

Now that we have the administrator hash, we can use `impacket-psexec` to log in as an administrator.  

```bash
impacket-psexec htb.local/administrator@10.129.236.33 -hashes :<nthashhere>
```

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/28.png)

---

## Post-Exploitation and Flag

We are finally in as admin!  

All we need to do is `cd c:\users\administrator\desktop` and `type root.txt`!

![](/assets/images/htb/forest/29.png)

## Key Takeaways

- Kerberos is a prime attack surface.
- user enumeration is critical.
- As-Rep roasting has high impact.
- DACL misconfigurations can lead to a full domain compromise.
