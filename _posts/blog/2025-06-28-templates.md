## Overview

I have had a few friends ask me about how I organize my notes and keep them together. I have shown them a template that I use and let them know that it was curated after so many trials and errors to fit my needs.  

**Note:** It is NOT perfect, and it doesn't have to be!

## Philosophy behind templates and Operational Benefits.

Templates are more than note-taking. It allows an operator to reduce cognitive load by offloading information into a file that can be referenced later on when necessary, while also allowing the operator to focus during engagements or exams.  

It also provides clarity not only to the operator but also to others when it is handed off or used for post-op reviews. Note-taking helps avoid repeated failed vectors or missing unexplored areas.  

It supports your reporting by taking the information you have provided and evolving it into a structured document.  

Your template will never be all-encompassing, and that's a good thing. You should be able to change or add headers when you, as an operator, feel it's necessary.  

In essence, it turns chaos into structured insight.

## What makes a good template?

**So what makes good notes?**  

This is very subjective and depends on your goals. Everyone approaches note-taking differently. After a few years of developing and refining my template, I have also come across many templates that people have created, and I have noticed a pattern.  

*Structure:*  
Having a separation between each phase of your engagement makes a difference.  

For example, I would separate your initial enumeration, exploitation, post-exploitation, and privilege escalation into their own headers (markdown was the best thing I learned).  

It allows you to mirror your workflow and methodology with ease, thanks to intuitive navigation and mental mapping.

*Adaptability:*

A template that works for CTFs, labs, and exams by allowing context-specific notes.  

It doesn't lock a user into a rigid method. We don't want a template that doesn't support the creativity and improvisation that we, as operators, may have to take.  

It prevents confusion and helps build a clear post-exploitation path.

*Journaling Capability:*  

The ability to allow us as operators to track our thoughts, our failures, what decisions we have made, and when we had to shift our tactics.  

It helps build a timeline of intent, not just the actions we have taken.

*Tool-Awareness:*

If used properly, your notes should include the tools and commands used, along with relevant information as output.  

It encourages reflection on tools and their effectiveness, as well as alternatives in case certain tools don't work.

*Minimal Friction:*

It should be easy to update mid-engagement by modifying or adding headers as needed.


*Report Ready:*

It can be easily converted into a report, summary, or guide to help you write your report or summary.

    Can be easily converted into a report, blog, or summary

    Fields naturally support post-engagement write-ups without duplicate effort.

## My Own Templates

In this section, I will post two templates: one for Windows and one for Linux, which I have used for CTFs and exams and found to be effective.  

In the section immediately below Nmap (port exploration), I like to list the ports I will be attacking and bullet my notes by port. 

***Windows Template:***
