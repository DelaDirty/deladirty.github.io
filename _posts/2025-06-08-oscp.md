## My Thoughts
<small>I’ve held the OSCP for a year now, but I failed before I made progress and passed.  
This post isn’t another exam-format recap OffSec already covers that.  
Instead, here’s  what I changed between fail and pass, plus the resources that still sit at the top of my bookmarks bar.</small>  

<small>When I first started working on the OSCP course, I was doing basic work with pentesting, such as enumerating, and was excited to get this exam and certification done and out of the way. It was my long-term goal since I started cyber back in 2019. Pentesting is what made me fall in love with cyber to begin with. I grew up watching movies like Hackers and have always been fascinated by the concept of hacking. I tried to push through the course as quickly as possible, thinking I could remember everything... I WAS WRONG!!</small>

<small>I learned the hard way that the OSCP course was there for one thing: to learn and understand how to create a methodology and how to pivot when things don't go your way. That, to me, is why the OSCP course is there. You need to learn on a deeper level why and how things work to break through them. I see many posts on Reddit stating that what people have seen wasn't in the course. I know I first felt this way when I failed the exam. I took a step back and objectively reviewed my methodology and notes, realizing they weren't up to par. I took some time to curate better notes that I can refer back to and use properly.</small>

## What Helped Me

<small>I reworked boxes and built out a methodology that I can use until it became second nature. Guess what? IT WORKED! To this day, I still review my notes and methodology, making changes or additions as necessary. I treat it as an organic document, adding or changing portions as necessary. I finally came to realize that looking at write-ups wasn't a bad thing. I always tell people, you don't know what you don't know. There is a caveat, though. If you are stuck and have been stuck, it's fine to look at a write-up as long as you are reading it and learning from it.   Many people seem to run the same commands as the write-up without understanding how the person arrived at them and why they work. Like anything else, use it as a tool, not a crutch! For many of us, this is the first time we are taking an exam in this format. Many of us were used to CompTIA-style exams. Practice time management with OSCP A, B, and C labs for the exam, which is why they are there. </small>

## Tips
<small> I recommend learning how to enumerate as you are going through the coursework manually, and when you start prepping for the exam, to use Autorecon. I would also recommend splitting your terminal and opening a local Python server where your autorecon folder is located, so you can view it through the web (this makes it a lot easier). OSCP isn't a race; it's about you learning and being engaged with the material, tools, and output. Please create your template and work through it while you're hacking these boxes. This was the one thing that made my life easier: creating a template where I could put my notes. They are everywhere online, but mold it to how you work through these boxes. I promise it makes things easier.

READ  
READ    
READ!! 

<small>I understand the frustration of trying to get everything done within 24 hours, but you HAVE to be able to read through the output, or you may miss something important. Learn to connect the dots with the information you have to find an entry point. Understand why the information is presented to you. Time management for the exam is important, but what's even more important is staying as calm as possible and avoiding a meltdown. It's easier said than done, but with practice, I know you can do it.</small>

### Reference Notes
- ([HDKS Exploitation Notes](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/))
- ([Juggernaut-Sec Priv Esc](https://juggernaut-sec.com/))
- ([GTFOBINS!](https://gtfobins.github.io))
- ([Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/index.html))

<small>There are a bunch of reference notes on GitHub for OSCP. I just wanted to give you a few specifically for priv esc that made a difference for me. These are great as a secondary set for priv esc.</small>

### Tools
- ([Autorecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon))
<small> Tibs, thank you for this tool!</small>  
- ([Penelope Shell Handler](https://github.com/brightio/penelope))
<small>I like penelope over netcat because it auto tty for you, so you don't need a secondary set of commands.</small>  
- ([ligolo-ng](https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng))
<small> People have a love/hate relationship with ligolo, but once you have it down, you won't go back to anything else. </small>
