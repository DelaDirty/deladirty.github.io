## whoami?


Hey, I'm DelaDirty. I currently work as an Incident Response Analyst on a DFIR team. I hold the OSCP certification and am currently ranked 657th globally on HackTheBox. I am also about to take the CRTO exam!  

Outside of work and study, you’ll usually find me playing guitar or tinkering with cars.  

My interest in hacking began as a kid; I was inspired by movies such as Hackers, which sparked my curiosity about tinkering. Just before the COVID pandemic, I decided to dive deeper and began learning enumeration while studying for my Network+ certification. That experience helped me connect the dots between networking concepts and reconnaissance techniques.  

I have been building computers since I was a kid; it was something I got into thanks to my dad. He always had systems torn apart and reassembled around the house. That hands-on exposure gave me a solid foundation in hardware.  

This blog will be used to share what I learn, from red team tactics to walkthroughs and beginner-friendly insights. Whether you’re just starting or looking to sharpen your skills, I hope you find something useful here.
